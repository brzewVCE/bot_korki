#A discrod bot for my math/programming tutoring lessons

## Functionality
Upon a new member's arrival, the bot requests their name and subsequently generates a dedicated section comprising both voice and text channels exclusively for that user. Access to these channels is restricted to the admin and the respective user. This system effectively organizes students into their individual spaces, ensuring they are unable to view other channels.


## Requirements

- Discord

You can install the required Python packages using the provided `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command:
